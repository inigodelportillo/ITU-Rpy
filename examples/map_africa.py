""" This example shows how to compute the atmospheric attenuation exceeded
for 0.1 % of the time of the average year over a large region of the Earth.

It is assumed that the satellite is located in geostationary orbit, at the
4 E slot, and the link operates at 22.5 GHz with receiver-dishes of 1.2 m
diameter.

The satellite covers Africa, Europe and the Middle East.

Finally, we also plot the surface mean temperature distribution to illustrate
that other variables can also be computed using vectorized operations.
