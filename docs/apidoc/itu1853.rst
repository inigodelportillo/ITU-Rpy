Recommendation ITU-R P.1853
---------------------------

This Recommendation provides methods to synthesize rain attenuation and scintillation for terrestrial and Earth-space paths and total attenuation and tropospheric scintillation for Earth-space paths.

Introduction
************

The planning and design of terrestrial and Earth-space radiocommunication systems requires the ability to synthesize the time dynamics of the propagation channel. For example, this information may be required to design various fade mitigation techniques such as, *inter alia*, adaptive coding and modulation, and transmit power control.

The methodology presented in this Recommendation provides a technique to synthesize rain attenuation and scintillation time series for terrestrial and Earth-space paths and total attenuation and tropospheric scintillation for Earth-space paths that approximate the rain attenuation statistics at a particular location.
