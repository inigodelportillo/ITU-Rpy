Recommendation ITU-R P.1511
---------------------------

This Recommendation provides global topographical data, information on geographic coordinates, and height data for the prediction of propagation effects for Earth-space paths in ITU-R recommendations.

.. include:: itu1511_table.rst

Introduction
************

This model shall be used to obtain the height above mean sea level when no local data are available or when no data with a better spatial resolution is available.

The values of topographic height of the surface of the Earth above mean sea level (km) are an integral part of this Recommendation. The data is provided on a 1/12Â° 
grid in both latitude and longitude. For a location different from the grid points, the height above mean sea level at the desired location can be obtained by 
performing a bi-cubic interpolation on the values at the sixteen closest grid points
