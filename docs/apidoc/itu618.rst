Recommendation ITU-R P.618
--------------------------

This Recommendation provides methods to predict the various propagation parameters needed in planning Earth-space systems operating in either the Earth-to-space or space-to-Earth direction.

Introduction
************

The propagation loss on an Earth-space path, relative to the free-space loss, is the sum of different contributions as follows:
* attenuation by atmospheric gases;
* attenuation by rain, other precipitation and clouds;
* focusing and defocusing;
* decrease in antenna gain due to wave-front incoherence;
* scintillation and multipath effects;
* attenuation by sand and dust storms.

Each of these contributions has its own characteristics as a function of frequency, geographic location and elevation angle. As a rule, at elevation angles above 10 degrees, only gaseous attenuation, rain and cloud attenuation and possibly scintillation will be significant, depending on propagation conditions.
