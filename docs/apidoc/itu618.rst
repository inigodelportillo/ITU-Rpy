Recommendation ITU-R P.618 provides methods to estimate the propagation
loss on an Earth-space path, relative to the free-space loss. This value
is the sum of different contributions as follows:
   * attenuation by atmospheric gases;
   * attenuation by rain, other precipitation and clouds;
   * focusing and defocusing;
   * decrease in antenna gain due to wave-front incoherence;
   * scintillation and multipath effects;
   * attenuation by sand and dust storms.
Each of these contributions has its own characteristics as a function of
frequency, geographic location and elevation angle. As a rule, at elevation
angles above 10°, only gaseous attenuation, rain and cloud attenuation and
possibly scintillation will be significant, depending on propagation
conditions.
