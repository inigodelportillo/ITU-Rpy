Recommendation ITU-R P.676
--------------------------

Implementation of the methods in Recommendation ITU-R P.676 "Attenuation by atmospheric gases".

Introduction
************

This Recommendation provides the following three methods of predicting the specific and path gaseous attenuation due to oxygen and water vapour:
* Calculation of specific and path gaseous attenuation using the line-by-line summation assuming the atmospheric pressure, temperature, and water vapour density vs. height;
* An approximate estimate of specific and path gaseous attenuation assuming the water vapour density at the surface of the Earth;
* An approximate estimate of path attenuation assuming the integrated water vapour content along the path.

These prediction methods can use local meteorological data, or reference atmospheres or meteorological maps corresponding to a desired probability of exceedance that are provided in other ITU-R P-series Recommendations. In the absence of local data, a combination of: a) the reference atmospheric profiles given in Recommendation ITU-R P.835 may be used, b) the mean annual global reference atmosphere given in Recommendation ITU-R P.835, c) the map of mean annual surface temperature in Recommendation ITU-R P.1510 and d) the maps of surface water vapour density vs. exceedance probability given in Recommendation ITU-R P.836 may be used in lieu of the standard ground-level surface water vapour density of 7.5 g/m3.

The method to compute an estimate of gaseous attenuation computed by a summation of individual absorption lines that is valid for the frequency range 1-1 000 GHz, and the method to compute a simplified approximate method to estimate gaseous attenuation that is applicable in the frequency range 1-350 GHz.
