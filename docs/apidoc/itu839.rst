Recommendation ITU-R P.839
--------------------------

This Recommendation provides a method to predict the rain height for propagation prediction.

.. include:: itu839_table.rst

Introduction
************

The mean annual rain height above mean sea level, hR, may be obtained from the 0° C isotherm as:

.. math::
    
    h_R = h_0 + 0.36 \qquad \text{km}

for areas of the world where no specific information is available, the mean annual 0° C isotherm height above mean sea level, h0, is an integral part of this Recommendation. The data is provided from 0° to 360° in longitude and from +90° to –90° in latitude. For a location different from the grid-points, the mean annual 0° C isotherm height above mean sea level at the desired location can be derived by performing a bilinear interpolation on the values at the four closest gridpoints.
