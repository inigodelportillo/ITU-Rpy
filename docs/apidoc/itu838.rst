Recommendation ITU-R P.838
--------------------------

This Recommendation provides a method to compute the specific attenuation for rain for use in prediction methods.

.. include:: itu838_table.rst

Introduction
************

The specific attenuation :math:`\gamma_R` (dB/km) is obtained from the rain rate :math:`R:math:` (mm/h) using the power-law
relationship:

.. math::
    \gamma_R = k R^{\alpha}
    
Values for the coefficients :math:`k` and :math:`\alpha` are determined as functions of frequency, f (GHz), and this
recommendation provides value valid in the range from 1 to 1 000 GHz. The models from Recommendation ITU-R P.838 have 
been developed from curve-fitting to power-law coefficients derived from scattering calculations:
