Recommendation ITU-R P.530
-----------------------------------

Propagation data and prediction methods required for the design of
terrestrial line-of-sight systems

Available versions:
   * P.530-16 (07/15) (Current version)

Not available versions:

This recommendation includes prediction methods for the propagation effects
that should be taken into account in the design of digital fixed
line-of-sight links, both in clear-air and rainfall conditions. It also
provides link design guidance in clear step-by-step procedures including
the use of mitigation techniques to minimize propagation impairments. The
final outage predicted is the base for other Recommendations addressing
error performance and availability.
