Recommendation ITU-R P.530
--------------------------

This Recommendation provides prediction methods for the propagation effects that should be taken into account in the design of digital fixed line-of-sight links, both in clear-air and rainfall conditions. It also provides link design guidance in clear step-by-step procedures including the use of mitigation techniques to minimize propagation impairments. The final outage predicted is the base for other Recommendations addressing error performance and availability.

Introduction
************

The propagation loss on a terrestrial line-of-sight path relative to the free-space loss (see Recommendation ITU-R P.525) is the sum of different contributions as follows:
* attenuation due to atmospheric gases;
* diffraction fading due to obstruction or partial obstruction of the path;
* fading due to multipath, beam spreading and scintillation;
* attenuation due to variation of the angle-of-arrival/launch;
* attenuation due to precipitation;
* attenuation due to sand and dust storms.
Each of these contributions has its own characteristics as a function of frequency, path length and geographic location. These are described in the paragraphs that follow.
