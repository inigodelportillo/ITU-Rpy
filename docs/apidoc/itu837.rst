Recommendation ITU-R P.837
--------------------------
This Recommendation provides a method to compute the characteristics of precipitation for propagation modelling

Introduction
************

Rainfall rate statistics with a 1-min integration time are required for the prediction of rain
attenuation in terrestrial and satellite links. Data of long-term measurements of rainfall rate may be
available from local sources, but only with higher integration times. This Recommendation provides
maps of meteorological parameters that have been obtained using the European Centre for Medium-Range 
Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA-40 re-analysis database, which are recommended for the prediction of 
rainfall rate statistics with a 1-min integration time, when local measurements are missing.
