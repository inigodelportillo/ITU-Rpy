Recommendation ITU-R P.835
-----------------------------------

Implementation of the methods in Recommendation ITU-R P.835 "Reference Standard Atmospheres".

Available versions:
   * P.835-5 (02/12) (Current version)

Not available versions:
   * P.835-1 (08/94) (Superseded)
   * P.835-2 (08/97) (Superseded)
   * P.835-3 (10/99) (Superseded)
   * P.835-4 (03/05) (Superseded)

The procedures to compute the reference standard atmosphere parameters
pressented in these versions are identical to those included in version
ITU_T P.835-5. Version 3 includes a dataset with vertical profiles for
353 locations over the world using 10 years of radiosonde observations
. Version 4 includes another dataset with monthly vertical profiles worldwide
(grid of 1.5 by 1.5 deg). None of these are currently implemente but TODO
work.
