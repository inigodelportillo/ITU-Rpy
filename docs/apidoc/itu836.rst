Recommendation ITU-R P.836
--------------------------
Implementation of the methods in Recommendation ITU-R P.836 "Water vapour: surface density and total columnar content".
This Recommendation provides methods to predict the surface water vapour density and total columnar water vapour content on Earth-space paths.

Introduction
************
Atmospheric water vapour and oxygen cause absorption at millimetre wavelengths especially in the proximity of absorption lines (see Recommendation ITU-R P.676). The concentration of atmospheric oxygen is relatively constant; however, the concentration of water vapour varies both geographically and with time.

For some applications, the total water vapour content along a path can be used for the calculation of
excess path length and for the attenuation due to atmospheric water vapour, where the attenuation
due to atmospheric water vapour is assumed to be proportional to the total water vapour content
through its specific mass absorption coefficient.

This Recommendation provides method used for global calculations of propagation effects that require an estimate of surface water vapour density or total columnar content of water vapour and its seasonal variation, when more accurate local data are not available.
