ITU-Rpy is developed and maintained by Inigo del Portillo (`inigo.del.portillo@gmail.com <mailto:inigo.del.portillo@gmail.com/>`_).

*ITU-Rpy* uses the `GitHub issue-tracker <https://github.com/iportillo/ITU-Rpy/issues>`_ to take care of bugs and questions. If you experience problems with *ITU-Rpy*, try to provide a full error report with all the typical information (OS, version, console-output, minimum working example, ...). This makes it a lot easier to reproduce the error and locate the problem.
